# Resources Directory

This directory contains resources for building and packaging the app.

## DMG Background

To customize the DMG installer background, add a file named `dmg-background.png` to this directory.

Recommended specifications:
- Format: PNG
- Size: 800x400 pixels
- Transparency: Supported
- Content: Include instructions showing users to drag the app to the Applications folder

If no background image is provided, the GitHub Action will create a DMG without a custom background.
